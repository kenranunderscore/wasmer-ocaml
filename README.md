# Wasmer OCaml

This is the (official) OCaml bindings for Wasmer.

# Usage

## Compiling, installing and checking

To compile the library, simply run `dune build` (to build) or `opam install .`
(to install). There are also integrated tests.

In case you are building it using Dune, you also need to install the
`libwasmer` Opam package.

# Documentation

The documentation is incomplete. To build it, the preferred (tested) method is
running `make doc`.
